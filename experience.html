<h1><p style="color:yellow"><font size="40">Experience</h1>
<p style="color:yellow"><font size="5">Basically based on my experience, i had faced a lot of situations which lead to success until right now i mean is Zero to Hero. i learned from the mistakes and took it as my experience to improve myself to become better than before.In academic, im not smart at all just a student who is stubborn and too lenient with the subjects that i had taken plus im too playful. Now, i learn from mistakes and become more powerful and take it as my best experience. After i finished my study in secondary school, i've joined Youth Community Party which i involved in politics for the youth. This is my journey begins, i started to learn with the elders who have a lot of experience in leadership, how to influence people and how to make a critical decision.This is where i believe with myself that i can master my leadership and now i can prove that i able to speak in front of the people without stutter or nervous. For me this is the best way that i really enjoy much so i can carry my strength to compete in University.
