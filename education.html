<h1><p style="color:yellow">Early Education</h1>
<p style="color:yellow"><font size="5">At the beginning of my education, I studied at assunta kindergarten where I started my step in gaining knowledge for 2 years, that is at the age of 5 years to 6 years.
I studied at a primary school named as sekolah kebangsaan bukit sekilau in 2007 until it ended in 2013.
I continued my studies to the secondary level at the Mahkota 2 sensory school where I completed my studies up to the SPM level for 5 years.
after getting excellent results, I started to study at the University  Technology Mara Kedah until now, which is 2021.For me it is very tough for to go through step by step but in terms of lessons, we should know that not every part has its sweetness but also have a few moments or things that make us down and give up to face the challenge but for me we need to push yourself over the limit to get the best results by implementing smart decision and always pray to ALLAH to seek for forguiveness and guide from ALLAH so this automatically can proove success to you ! try it then ! ‚ù§</p>

<h2><p style="color:yellow"><font size="40">Life Education</h2>
<p style="color:yellow"><font size="5"> In life education, thought me lots of lesson, which i need to approach good vibes to make sure that i always positive in any kind of decision or situation. this is because calmness is one of the traits that very hard to achieve so we need to train daily to keep calm in every situation we face. God Willing , ALLAH will help you encourage your patience and be an independent person!</p>
