<p style="color:pink"><font size="20">Family means different things to different people.

To some, family means mom, dad and the kids.
To others, family means single parents doing the job of two to make a home.
To some, family means living with grandparents too.
To others, family is the aunt or uncle who has stepped up to fill in for parents.
To some, family means two moms or two dads growing a family together.
To others, family means two people multiplying their love through adoption.
To some, family is limited to blood relations.
To others, family includes friends who are there through thick and thin.
To some, family is all about the people in their lives.
To others, pets are considered family members too.

Yes, family means different things to different people,
But every family has one thing in common, and that's love. - By Kelly Roper

<p style="color:pink"font size="5">Poems About Family Love and Support
A family is made up of people who are there for you when you need, especially in challenging times. That support comes in many forms as these poems will show.


<h2><p style="color:pink"><font size="40">Family Tree
By Alison Jean Thomas.</h2>

<p style="color:pink"font size="5">It seems strange to me
That a family tree is drawn from the top of the page.
Instead, draw mine with roots deeply planted in firm ground
Like forefathers, whose stories retold,
Nourish us.
Draw the trunk giving support and power,
Strongly branching out
So that young shoots can reach high
And buds,
Some yet unfurled,
May catch dreams in sunlight.
